# SQL Query Runner and Data Visualization

A frontend application that enables data analysts to run SQL-like queries against CSV data files and visualize results through interactive charts and graphs.

## üìå Overview

This project provides an intuitive interface for data analysts to query and visualize data without requiring a database backend. It processes CSV files directly in the browser, supports SQL-like query syntax, and offers powerful visualization tools to gain insights from the data.

## ‚ú® Features

### Query Execution
- Write and execute SQL-like queries in a user-friendly editor
- Process queries against CSV data files
- Support for common SQL operations (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY)

### Data Visualization
- Transform query results into interactive visualizations:
  - Bar Graphs
  - Pie Charts
  - Line Charts
- Configure charts based on selected columns

### Query Modes
- **SQL Editor Mode** (default): Enter custom queries
- **Predefined Queries Mode**: Access commonly used queries with a toggle switch

### Query History & Management
- Automatic storage of executed queries
- Delete functionality for managing history
- Search capability to find specific past queries
- Visualization support for all historical queries

### Data Export
- Download query results as CSV files
- Export functionality available for both current and previous query results

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **React**: Frontend UI library
- **Chart.js & react-chartjs-2**: Data visualization
- **PapaParse**: CSV file parsing and processing
- **Styled-components**: Component styling
- **React-icons**: UI icon elements
